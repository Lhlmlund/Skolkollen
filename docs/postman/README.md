This collection contains ready-to-use requests for both **Schools** and **Programs** APIs.Â¨



## Setup

1. Import `Skolkollen.postman_collection.json` into Postman.
2. Create an environment:
   - `base_url` = `http://localhost:3000/api`
3. Select that environment in the top-right corner.


- Run individual requests, or open the **Collection Runner** to execute all CRUD tests.
- The collection stores created IDs automatically in variables (`schoolId`, `programId`).


## Notes

- Works out of the box with the local backend 'npm run dev'
